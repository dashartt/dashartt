<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;Sobre mim </h3>

- I love programming, having ideas in mind and making them real is amazing. Creating games aroused a lot of interest in programming and at one time I studied C# and Unity Engine to create a DDTank Prototype, the project started in 2018 but did not continue after that same year, however, someday I intend to resume and fulfill a childhood dream to build a 2D game<br> 

- In my free time I love to enjoy it with people by my side, with friends hanging out with them around town or playing some games. I like series, anime, manga and books more focused on the theme of self-knowledge <br>
